The display of **taxonomies** may be overridden in any project using Quetzal by creating the file `layouts/taxonomy.html`. Note that it uses `layouts/baseof.html` as a site-wide base. The taxonomy file controls the display of all taxonomies on the site.

Taxonomies refer to categorizations, which by default refer to `categories` and `tags` but may be changed to suit your needs.

If you are looking to control the display of the specific category or tag pages instead of the display of all taxonomies, refer to [term](/override/term).
