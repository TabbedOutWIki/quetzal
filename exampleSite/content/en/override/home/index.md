The **homepage** may be overridden in any project using Quetzal by creating the file `layouts/home.html`. Note that it uses `layouts/baseof.html` as a site-wide base.

Once created, this file may be customized to use any HTML/CSS/JS combined with Hugo logic (such as self-defined partials created in `layouts/_partials/filename.html`) to piece together a detailed page.
