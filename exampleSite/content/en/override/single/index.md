The display of **singles** may be overridden in any project using Quetzal by creating the file `layouts/single.html`. Note that it uses `layouts/baseof.html` as a site-wide base.

This allows you to adjust all article pages using HTML/CSS/JS or Hugo logic. Partials may also be created and referenced to separate logic such as `layouts/_partials/filename.html`.
