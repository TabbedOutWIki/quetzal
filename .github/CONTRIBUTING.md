## Issues and PRs

Any questions, bug reports, or suggestions can be submitted in the "Issues" tab. Any and all pull requests are welcome, though if you're going to make a large pull request, consider making an issue first. 

## Submitting pull requests

This part isn't as bad as it sounds. If you are lost, feel free to join our community linked at the bottom.

1. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository.
2. Grab the current development branch: `git checkout development`
3. Create a new branch rooted from the development branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
4. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

We'll have to review and approve your changes before merging them. Here is what you can do to make that process easier.

- Check for lint/syntax errors: `pnpm lint`
- Have your PR solve one specific thing. Separate commits for separate changes.
- Write a commit message adequately describing changes.

You may also submit pull requests in progress for feedback.
